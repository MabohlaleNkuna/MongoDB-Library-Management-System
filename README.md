## Introduction

This project focuses on the basic MongoDB commands and terminology needed to interact with a database via **MongoDB Compass**. It includes CRUD operations on collections such as **Books**, **Authors**, and **Patrons**, as well as more complex queries.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **MongoDB Compass**: Make sure you have **MongoDB Compass** installed. If not, [install it here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).
- **MongoDB Shell (Mongosh)**: You can also use **MongoDB Shell** for command-line operations. [Install it here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell).

### Steps to Connect to MongoDB via MongoDB Compass

1. Download and install **MongoDB Compass**.
2. Launch **MongoDB Compass** and connect using `localhost:27017` (if you are running a local instance of MongoDB).
3. Create a new database called `LibraryDB`.
4. Once connected, you can begin creating collections and inserting documents.

---

## Database Creation

Once connected to **MongoDB Compass**, create the `LibraryDB` database by simply entering `LibraryDB` in the database name field in **Compass** and clicking "Create Database."

---

## Collections and Documents

### Books Collection

To create the `Books` collection, navigate to **Compass**, select `LibraryDB`, and create a new collection called `Books`.

Hereâ€™s an example of a document in the `Books` collection:

```json
{
  "_id": 1,
  "title": "1984",
  "author_id": 1,
  "published_year": 1949,
  "available": true
}
